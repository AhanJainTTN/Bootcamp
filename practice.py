# Generators: In Python, a generator is a function that returns an iterator that produces a sequence of values when iterated over. Generators are useful when we want to produce a large sequence of values, but we don't want to store all of them in memory at once.
# When the generator function is called, it does not execute the function body immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object that can be iterated over to produce the values.
# The yield keyword is used to produce a value from the generator and pause the generator function's execution until the next value is requested.
